# E03b-JSON
This is the completed assignment. I will say that this game works, but does not allow the player to access the new locations I created. Based on what I am seeing the rooms I added follow the same scheme as the other rooms that already existed. I could not find a way for them to be accessed by the player though. For instance, I made a room called "Dungeon". I made a direct path to get to this room from the starting point by typing "east" to go to the back of the house. Then they could go into the basemnet by typing "creepy". Once in the basement they should be able to type "smokey" to get to the "dungeon". Once there, the game would be over and say the player was "in hell". Unfortunately, this did not work. The code did not say anything was wrong and would let me go anywhere else that was already put into the game. It just wouldn't let me add new locations for the player to go to.
